# STEP 22 COMPLETE ‚úÖ

## Manual Override System - Conflict Handling & User Control

**Implementation Date**: December 2024  
**Status**: ‚úÖ **COMPLETE** 
**Verification**: 5/5 tests passed (100% success rate)

---

## üéØ Objectives Achieved

### ‚úÖ Non-blocking Banner System
- **Conflict Banner Widget**: Smooth slide-in/slide-out notifications for original selection conflicts
- **Banner Manager**: Queue system for multiple concurrent conflicts with configurable capacity
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Clear options with file comparisons and decision controls
- **Auto-dismiss**: Configurable timeout (default 30 seconds) with manual dismiss option

### ‚úÖ Manual Override Database System
- **Persistent Storage**: New `manual_overrides` table with comprehensive foreign key relationships
- **Override Types**: Support for single-group and default-rule overrides
- **Reason Tracking**: Categorized reasons (user_preference, quality_better, format_preference, etc.)
- **Statistics**: Complete override usage tracking and reporting

### ‚úÖ Conflict Detection & Resolution
- **Automatic Detection**: System identifies when user preferences differ from automatic selection
- **Missing File Handling**: Graceful fallback when manually selected originals disappear
- **Cross-Session Persistence**: Overrides maintain across application restarts and rescans
- **Conflict Reporting**: Comprehensive conflict information with confidence scores

### ‚úÖ GroupingEngine Integration
- **Override-Aware Selection**: Enhanced `_select_original` method checks for manual overrides
- **Seamless Integration**: Manual overrides transparently applied during grouping process
- **Statistics Integration**: Override metrics included in grouping statistics
- **API Extensions**: New methods for applying, removing, and checking overrides

## üìã Implementation Details

### Core Components

**1. Manual Override Manager** (`src/ops/manual_override.py`)
- Database operations for override storage and retrieval
- Conflict detection algorithms
- Override persistence and validation
- Statistics collection and reporting

**2. Conflict Banner System** (`src/gui/conflict_banner.py`)
- Qt-based non-blocking notification widgets
- Animated banner display with user interaction
- Queue management for multiple conflicts
- Graceful degradation for non-GUI environments

**3. GroupingEngine Enhancements** (`src/ops/grouping.py`)
- Override-aware original selection logic
- Conflict detection during rescans
- Manual override application and removal APIs
- Missing file handling with automatic cleanup

### Database Schema

```sql
-- New table for tracking manual overrides
CREATE TABLE manual_overrides (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    group_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    original_file_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    auto_original_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    override_type TEXT NOT NULL,
    reason TEXT NOT NULL,
    created_at REAL NOT NULL,
    notes TEXT,
    is_active BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 1,
    FOREIGN KEY (group_id) REFERENCES groups (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (original_file_id) REFERENCES files (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    FOREIGN KEY (auto_original_id) REFERENCES files (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    UNIQUE (group_id, is_active)
);
```

### User Workflow

1. **Conflict Detection**: System detects difference between auto and user preference
2. **Banner Display**: Non-blocking notification appears with both options
3. **User Decision**: Choice between automatic selection or user preference
4. **Override Application**: Decision stored in database with metadata
5. **Persistence**: Override maintained across rescans unless original disappears
